            <h2>About</h2>
            <div id="about-text">
                <p>Harry James Potter is a fictional character and the titular protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels.</p>
                <p>The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort - the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter.</p>
                <p>The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.</p>

                <h2>Character Traits</h2>
                <h3>School House: Gryffindor</h3>
                <p>Gryffindors are known for being bold, courageous, and adventurous. Brave Gryffindors never shy away from a challenge, and they fearlessly pursue their goals. Gryffindors are chivalrous and have strong moral compasses. They believe in using their strength and courage to do what's right.</p>
                <h3>Quidditch Position: Seeker</h3>
                <p>There is one Seeker per team. The goal of the Seeker is to catch the Golden Snitch. They play a crucial role in Quidditch, as a game does not end until the Seeker catches the Snitch. A team whose Seeker catches the Snitch receives 150 points, which almost always wins the match for that team. Seekers are generally the smallest and lightest players on a team, and there is a certain glamour attached to playing as a Seeker. Generally, the Seeker is also the most fouled player on the team.</p>
